Before his cohort began he had already taught himself angular and built a few apps using the framework. All throughout the bootcamp he demonstrated an intense desire to learn, enduring positive attitude, and openness to feedback that many new developers with his level of skill tend to lack. It is my sincere opinion that he possesses all of the qualities and aptitudes that would would make him a fantastic addition to any development team. "</p>
